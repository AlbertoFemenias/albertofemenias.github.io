I implemented a very simple genetic algorithm in which a population of "ants" have to reach a destination
while avoiding crashing with the walls of the board or falling into a blackhole.

**Instructions:**
You can play with the algorithm and see how it responds by changing the population (number of ants), the mutation (the difference between the best ants and their clones) and the
parents (the best ants chosen for the next generation).
