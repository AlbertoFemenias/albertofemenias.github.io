This is a pretty cool game, instead of asteroids, you have to shoot polygons in order to survive and get to the next level.
This game has some impressive sound effects, so make sure you have the volume to the max.

**Instructions:**
You can move your spaceship using the arrow keys. Shoot the asteroids with the space bar, there is a maximum burst of shots.
To pass to the next level you must destroy all polygons. Have fun!
