For my second game, I developed an oldschool Snake game where you can change the dimensions of the board.

**Instructions:**
Use the arrow keys to start the game and move your snake. If you crash into a wall you will die. If you eat yourself you just shrink so don't worry
If you wish to start again you can just press the restart the button.
With the sliders you can customize the width and height of the board


<div align="center">
<canvas id="gc" width="450" height="450"></canvas>
<style> .slider { width: 350px;} </style>
<br>
Height <input type="range" min="10" max="40" value="15" class="slider" id="sheight">
<br>
Width <input type="range" min="10" max="40" value="15" class="slider" id="swidth">
<br>
<button onclick="reset()">Reset</button>
